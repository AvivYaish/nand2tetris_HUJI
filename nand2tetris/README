// ShiftLeft.hdl, ShiftRight.hdl	- chips that perform shifts
// ExtendAlu.hdl, CpuMul.hdl		- ALU & CPU that support shifts
//
// All tools (Assembler, CPUEmulator, VMEmulator, JackCompiler) support shifts.
// Assembler, CPUEmulator: 
// dest=D<<;jump  // left-shift
// dest=D>>;jump  // right-shift
// Also works with A, M
//
// VMEmulator: 
// shiftleft, shiftright are unary operations that perforn their namesake
//
// JackCompiler:
// '^', '#' are unary operators for left and right shifts (respectively)
