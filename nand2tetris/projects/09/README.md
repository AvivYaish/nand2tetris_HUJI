# Project 9: High-Level Programming

## Implementation Details

Your submission should compile successfully on the built in JackCompiler and
run successfully on the built in VMEmulator using the built-in OS.

Your game can be an unoriginal idea (Tetris, Snake, etc'), but must be
original code - you can't use code you found online!

The program should be comparable in scope to Tetris/Snake/Pong, shorter
projects will be penalized. Although the number of code-lines is not a good
estimation of the amount of effort put into a project, a project of less
than 600 "meaningful" lines is definitely too short.
Whitespace, comments, and various fluff (such as the class/function
definition lines, variable declaration, code that prints bitmaps, etc)
don't count as "meaningful".

You should make use of all OS classes directly and demonstrate a thorough
knowledge of the OS API and Jack language features (classes, members,
methods, loops, types, operators, etc'). Make a list of all such features
and make sure you're using each one in a non-trivial way.

Usage should be meaningful in the context of your program - don't call
functions and throw away their results or define useless variables!

## Tools

For more information about our built-in tools, see the tutorials in the
lectures and submission page, and additional information provided in
tools/README.md.

This file includes a general introduction to writing in Jack (see
"Developing Jack Applications").
Additionally, project 12's README.md includes the API of the entire OS,
and a list of OS errorcodes.
Finally, project 10's JackTokenizer.py includes a list of all Jack features.

## What To Submit

- You should submit a zip file with the following files:
  AUTHORS and all your .jack files.
- The submission should not contain any folder.
- The submission should not contain any OS implementation.
- The AUTHORS file must contain the following:
  - In the first line: login(s) of the author(s), separated by commas and
    nothing else! If you work alone, do not include a comma.
    Logins should be identical to the names of your home folders and are
    case-sensitive.
  - Name(s), email(s) and ID(s) of the project's author(s).
  - Any remarks you have about your submission.

## A Message From Aviv

Each semester, course staff is delighted to see the cool ideas you come up with.
I hope your games are fun, I can't wait to see them all!
