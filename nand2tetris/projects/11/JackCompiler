# **** Why do we need this file? ****
# The purpose of this file is to run your project.
# We want our users to have a simple API to run the project. 
# So, we need a "wrapper" that will hide all  details to do so,
# enabling users to simply type 'JackCompiler <path>' in order to use it.

# **** What are '#!/bin/sh' and '$*'? ****
# '$*' is a variable that holds all the arguments this file has received. So, if you
# run "JackCompiler trout mask replica", $* will hold "trout mask replica".

# **** What should I change in this file to make it work with my project? ****
# IMPORTANT: This file assumes that the main is contained in "JackCompiler.py".
#			 If your main is contained elsewhere, you will need to change this.
