# Project 3 - Sequential Logic

## Submitted Files
- README: This file.
- a/Bit.hdl: 
- a/PC.hdl: 
- a/RAM8.hdl: 
- a/RAM64.hdl: 
- a/Register.hdl: 
- b/RAM4K.hdl: 
- b/RAM16K.hdl: 
- b/RAM512.hdl:  

## Remarks
- You should submit a tar file containing two directories named 'a' and 'b',
and a README in the root directory (not in 'a' or 'b').
- Directory 'a' should include Bit.hdl, PC.hdl, RAM8.hdl, RAM64.hdl and
Register.hdl, while directory 'b' should include RAM4K.hdl, RAM16K.hdl and
RAM512.hdl.
- If a chip from directory 'a' uses an external chip (say X.hdl), the external
chip should be placed in directory 'a' too. The same goes for directory 'b'.
In case chips from both directories use X.hdl, it should be placed in both
directories.
- External chips are chips that you weren't requested to build in the current
or previous projects, and that are not built-in.
- Include other files required by your project, if there are any.
- The README file must contain the following:
	- In the first line: login(s) of the author(s), 
	separated by commas and nothing else! 
	If you work alone, do not include a comma. 
	Logins should be identical to the names of your home folders and are 
	case-sensitive.
	- Name(s), email(s) and ID(s) of the project's author(s).
	- Any remarks you have about your submission.
