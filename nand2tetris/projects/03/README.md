# Project 3: Sequential Logic

## What To Submit

- You should submit a zip file with the following files:
  two directories named 'a' and 'b', and an AUTHORS file in the root directory
  (not in 'a' or 'b').
  Folder 'a' should contain: Bit.hdl, PC.hdl, RAM8.hdl, RAM64.hdl, Register.hdl.
  Folder 'b' should contain: RAM4K.hdl, RAM16K.hdl and RAM512.hdl.
- If a chip from directory 'a' uses external chips, say X.hdl, these chips
  should be placed in 'a', too. The same goes for directory 'b'. If chips from
  both directories use X.hdl, it should be placed in both.
- External chips are chips that you were not requested to build in the current
  or previous projects, and that are not built-in.
- Include other files required by your project, if there are any.
- The AUTHORS file must contain the following:
  - In the first line: login(s) of the author(s), separated by commas and
    nothing else! If you work alone, do not include a comma.
    Logins should be identical to the names of your home folders and are
    case-sensitive.
  - Name(s), email(s) and ID(s) of the project's author(s).
  - Any remarks you have about your submission.
