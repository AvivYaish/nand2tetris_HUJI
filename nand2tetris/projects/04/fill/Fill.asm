// This program illustrates low-level handling of the screen and keyboard
// devices, as follows.
//
// The program runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input.
// When a key is pressed (any key), the program blackens the screen,
// i.e. writes "black" in every pixel;
// the screen should remain fully black as long as the key is pressed. 
// When no key is pressed, the program clears the screen, i.e. writes
// "white" in every pixel;
// the screen should remain fully clear as long as no key is pressed.
// 
// Assumptions:
// Your program may blacken and clear the screen's pixels in any spatial/visual
// Order, as long as pressing a key continuously for long enough results in a
// fully blackened screen, and not pressing any key for long enough results in a
// fully cleared screen.
//
// Test Scripts:
// For completeness of testing, test the Fill program both interactively and
// automatically.
// 
// The supplied FillAutomatic.tst script, along with the supplied compare file
// FillAutomatic.cmp, are designed to test the Fill program automatically, as 
// described by the test script documentation.
//
// The supplied Fill.tst script, which comes with no compare file, is designed
// to do two things:
// - Load the Fill.hack program
// - Remind you to select 'no animation', and then test the program
//   interactively by pressing and releasing some keyboard keys

// Put your code here.
