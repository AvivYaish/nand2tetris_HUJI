// The program should swap between the max. and min. elements of an array.
// Assumptions:
// - The array's start address is stored in R14, and R15 contains its length
// - Each array value x is between -16384 < x < 16384
// - The address in R14 is at least >= 2048
// - R14 + R15 <= 16383
//
// Requirements:
// - Changing R14, R15 is not allowed.
