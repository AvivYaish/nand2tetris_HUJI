# Project 8 - Virtual Machine (Control)

## Submitted Files
- README: This file.
- VMtranslator: The executable.
- Makefile: A makefile for the project.
- Main.py: The project's main .py file.
- Parser.py: Handles the parsing of a single .vm file.
- CodeWriter.py: Translates VM commands into Hack assembly code.

## Remarks
- Your tar should only include a run-script named 'VMtranslator', a Makefile 
called "Makefile", a README, and the source code for your implementation.
- You can change the template however you want, or even not use it at all. But,
  your project should use the same standard installation and running procedures,
  and standard inputs that the template uses. 
- Include other files required by your project, if there are any.
- The README file must contain the following:
	- In the first line: login(s) of the author(s), 
	separated by commas and nothing else! 
	If you work alone, do not include a comma. 
	Logins should be identical to the names of your home folders and are 
	case-sensitive.
	- Name(s), email(s) and ID(s) of the project's author(s).
	- Any remarks you have about your submission.
