## Remarks

- Your zip should only include a run-script named 'VMtranslator', a Makefile
  called "Makefile", a README.md file, and the source code for your
  implementation.
- You can change the template however you want, or even not use it at all. But,
  your project should use the same standard installation and running procedures,
  and standard inputs that the template uses.
- Include other files required by your project, if there are any.
- The README.md file must contain the following:
  - In the first line: login(s) of the author(s), separated by commas and
    nothing else! If you work alone, do not include a comma.
    Logins should be identical to the names of your home folders and are
    case-sensitive.
  - Name(s), email(s) and ID(s) of the project's author(s).
  - Any remarks you have about your submission.
