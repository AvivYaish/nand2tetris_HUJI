  A run-file named 'VMtranslator', a Makefile called "Makefile", a README.md file,
  and the source code for your implementation.
- The submission should not contain any folder.
- The README.md file must contain the following:
  - In the first line: login(s) of the author(s), separated by commas and

    case-sensitive.
