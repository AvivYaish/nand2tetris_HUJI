And, a message from Aviv:

If you enjoyed this course, here are some recommendations:

- [**`Stanford's compilers course`**](https://www.edx.org/course/compilers) 
dives deeper into compilers, and guides you in building a modern compiler from 
scratch! Although our compiler works, it is quite simplistic in comparison.

- [**`Stanford's operating systems`**](https://cs140e.sergio.bz/about/) course
covers building an operating system for the Raspberry Pi computer.

- [**`Web Browser Engineering`**](https://browser.engineering/) is a course 
that shows you how to build a web browser, step-by-step. Web-browsing is maybe 
the major task people use computers for, so this is quite important.

- [**`Berkeley's Intro2AI course`**](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html)
is a perfect fit for those of you who liked the tetris part of our course. 
This course uses very hands-on and visual projects to teach you the basics of
Artificial Intelligence.
