## A message from Aviv

If you enjoyed this course, here are some recommendations:

- [**`HUJI's Introduction to Cryptography and Software Security (67932)`**](https://moodle2.cs.huji.ac.il/nu20/course/view.php?id=67392)
  is a great course that shows how some of the principals taught in nand2tet
  affect the security of modern computers.

- [**`HUJI's Computer Architecture course (67200)`**](https://moodle2.cs.huji.ac.il/nu20/course/view.php?id=67200)
  delves deeper into the fascinating world of processor design.

- [**`Stanford's Compilers course`**](https://www.edx.org/course/compilers)
  dives deeper into compilers, and guides you in building a modern compiler from
  scratch! Although our compiler works, it is quite simplistic in comparison.

- [**`Stanford's Operating Systems course`**](https://cs140e.sergio.bz/about/)
  covers building an operating system for the Raspberry Pi computer.

- [**`Writing an OS in Rust`**](https://os.phil-opp.com/) is a blog that guides
  you through the process of writing an Operating System in Rust!

- [**`Web Browser Engineering`**](https://browser.engineering/) is a course
  that shows you how to build a web browser, step-by-step. Web-browsing is maybe
  the major task people use computers for, so this is quite important.

- [**`Berkeley's Intro2AI course`**](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html)
  is a perfect fit for those of you who liked the tetris part of our course.
  This course uses very hands-on and visual projects to teach you the basics of
  Artificial Intelligence. HUJI offers an equivalent course called
  [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (67842)](https://moodle2.cs.huji.ac.il/nu20/course/view.php?name=ai).
