class JackTokenizer:
    """Removes all comments from the input stream and breaks it
    into Jack language tokens, as specified by the Jack grammar.
    
    An Xxx .jack file is a stream of characters. If the file represents a
    valid program, it can be tokenized into a stream of valid tokens. The
    tokens may be separated by an arbitrary number of space characters, 
    newline characters, and comments, which are ignored. There are three 
    possible comment formats: /* comment until closing */ , /** API comment 
    until closing */ , and // comment until the line’s end.

    ‘xxx’: quotes are used for tokens that appear verbatim (‘terminals’);
    xxx: regular typeface is used for names of language constructs 
    (‘non-terminals’);
    (): parentheses are used for grouping of language constructs;
    x | y: indicates that either x or y can appear;
    x?: indicates that x appears 0 or 1 times;
    x*: indicates that x appears 0 or more times.

    ** Lexical elements **
    The Jack language includes five types of terminal elements (tokens).
    1. keyword: 'class' | 'constructor' | 'function' | 'method' | 'field' | 
        'static' | 'var' | 'int' | 'char' | 'boolean' | 'void' | 'true' | 'false'
        | 'null' | 'this' | 'let' | 'do' | 'if' | 'else' | 'while' | 'return'
    2. symbol:  '{' | '}' | '(' | ')' | '[' | ']' | '.' | ',' | ';' | '+' | 
        '-' | '*' | '/' | '&' | '|' | '<' | '>' | '=' | '~' | '^' | '#'
    3. integerConstant: A decimal number in the range 0-32767.
    4. StringConstant: '"' A sequence of Unicode characters not including 
        double quote or newline '"'
    5. identifier: A sequence of letters, digits, and underscore ('_') not 
        starting with a digit.


    ** Program structure **
    A Jack program is a collection of classes, each appearing in a separate 
    file. The compilation unit is a class. A class is a sequence of tokens 
    structured according to the following context free syntax:
    
    class: 'class' className '{' classVarDec* subroutineDec* '}'
    classVarDec: ('static' | 'field') type varName (',' varName)* ';'
    type: 'int' | 'char' | 'boolean' | className
    subroutineDec: ('constructor' | 'function' | 'method') ('void' | type) 
    subroutineName '(' parameterList ')' subroutineBody
    parameterList: ((type varName) (',' type varName)*)?
    subroutineBody: '{' varDec* statements '}'
    varDec: 'var' type varName (',' varName)* ';'
    className: identifier
    subroutineName: identifier
    varName: identifier


    ** Statements **
    statements: statement*
    statement: letStatement | ifStatement | whileStatement | doStatement | 
        returnStatement
    letStatement: 'let' varName ('[' expression ']')? '=' expression ';'
    ifStatement: 'if' '(' expression ')' '{' statements '}' ('else' '{' 
        statements '}')?
    whileStatement: 'while' '(' 'expression' ')' '{' statements '}'
    doStatement: 'do' subroutineCall ';'
    returnStatement: 'return' expression? ';'


    ** Expressions **
    expression: term (op term)*
    term: integerConstant | stringConstant | keywordConstant | varName | 
        varName '['expression']' | subroutineCall | '(' expression ')' | 
        unaryOp term
    subroutineCall: subroutineName '(' expressionList ')' | (className | 
        varName) '.' subroutineName '(' expressionList ')'
    expressionList: (expression (',' expression)* )?
    op: '+' | '-' | '*' | '/' | '&' | '|' | '<' | '>' | '='
    unaryOp: '-' | '~' | '^' | '#'
    keywordConstant: 'true' | 'false' | 'null' | 'this'
    
    If you are wondering whether some Jack program is valid or not, you should
    use the built-in JackCompiler to compiler it. If the compilation fails, it
    is invalid. Otherwise, it is valid.
