    # Jack Language Grammar

    A Jack file is a stream of characters. If the file represents a
    valid program, it can be tokenized into a stream of valid tokens. The
    tokens may be separated by an arbitrary number of whitespace characters, 
    and comments, which are ignored. There are three possible comment formats: 
    /* comment until closing */ , /** API comment until closing */ , and 
    // comment until the line’s end.

    - ‘xxx’: quotes are used for tokens that appear verbatim (‘terminals’).
    - xxx: regular typeface is used for names of language constructs 
           (‘non-terminals’).
    - (): parentheses are used for grouping of language constructs.
    - x | y: indicates that either x or y can appear.
    - x?: indicates that x appears 0 or 1 times.
    - x*: indicates that x appears 0 or more times.

    ## Lexical Elements

    The Jack language includes five types of terminal elements (tokens).

    - keyword: 'class' | 'constructor' | 'function' | 'method' | 'field' | 
               'static' | 'var' | 'int' | 'char' | 'boolean' | 'void' | 'true' |
               'false' | 'null' | 'this' | 'let' | 'do' | 'if' | 'else' | 
               'while' | 'return'
    - symbol: '{' | '}' | '(' | ')' | '[' | ']' | '.' | ',' | ';' | '+' | 
              '-' | '*' | '/' | '&' | '|' | '<' | '>' | '=' | '~' | '^' | '#'
    - integerConstant: A decimal number in the range 0-32767.
    - StringConstant: '"' A sequence of Unicode characters not including 
                      double quote or newline '"'
    - identifier: A sequence of letters, digits, and underscore ('_') not 
                  starting with a digit. You can assume keywords cannot be
                  identifiers, so 'self' cannot be an identifier, etc'.

    ## Program Structure

    A Jack program is a collection of classes, each appearing in a separate 
    file. A compilation unit is a single class. A class is a sequence of tokens 
    structured according to the following context free syntax:
    
    - class: 'class' className '{' classVarDec* subroutineDec* '}'
    - classVarDec: ('static' | 'field') type varName (',' varName)* ';'
    - type: 'int' | 'char' | 'boolean' | className
    - subroutineDec: ('constructor' | 'function' | 'method') ('void' | type) 
    - subroutineName '(' parameterList ')' subroutineBody
    - parameterList: ((type varName) (',' type varName)*)?
    - subroutineBody: '{' varDec* statements '}'
    - varDec: 'var' type varName (',' varName)* ';'
    - className: identifier
    - subroutineName: identifier
    - varName: identifier

    ## Statements

    - statements: statement*
    - statement: letStatement | ifStatement | whileStatement | doStatement | 
                 returnStatement
    - letStatement: 'let' varName ('[' expression ']')? '=' expression ';'
    - ifStatement: 'if' '(' expression ')' '{' statements '}' ('else' '{' 
                   statements '}')?
    - whileStatement: 'while' '(' 'expression' ')' '{' statements '}'
    - doStatement: 'do' subroutineCall ';'
    - returnStatement: 'return' expression? ';'

    ## Expressions
    
    - expression: term (op term)*
    - term: integerConstant | stringConstant | keywordConstant | varName | 
            varName '['expression']' | subroutineCall | '(' expression ')' | 
            unaryOp term
    - subroutineCall: subroutineName '(' expressionList ')' | (className | 
                      varName) '.' subroutineName '(' expressionList ')'
    - expressionList: (expression (',' expression)* )?
    - op: '+' | '-' | '*' | '/' | '&' | '|' | '<' | '>' | '='
    - unaryOp: '-' | '~' | '^' | '#'
    - keywordConstant: 'true' | 'false' | 'null' | 'this'
    
    Note that ^, # correspond to shiftleft and shiftright, respectively.
